# Machine Learning and Data Analytics in Python
------

**Caveat:** This repository is not updated anymore.


This repository provides python examples for better understanding of some fundamental machine learning tools. Currently it includes the following topics:

* Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, MDS, Isomap, Diffusion Maps)
* Fihser's Linear Discriminant Analysis and Maximum Likelihood Discriminant Analysis
* K-means clustering
* Support Vector Machines (primal and dual problems, Kernel based methods)


These codes are supplementary materials for the lecture [Fundamentals of Big Data Analytics](https://www.ti.rwth-aachen.de/teaching/BigData/ws1718/).
